Instructables - Step by step guide - https://www.instructables.com/Medusa-a-Sound-Effects-Synth-Eurorack-Module-or-St/

4 Main Knobs:

         Pot 1 (Pitch) - Controls the base frequency/note
    
         Pot 2 (Speed) - Controls how fast things move (LFO speed, tempo, etc.)

         Pot 3 (Modulation) - Controls effect intensity (vibrato, filter, etc.)
    
         Pot 4 (Echo Feedback) - Controls how much echo/delay repeats

Main Buttons:

          TRIGGER - Hold to play sound
          
          MENU - Cycles through 4 instruments (Dub Siren → Ray Gun → Lead Synth → Disco)
          
          MODE - Changes the sound variation within each instrument
          
         DELAY - Cycles delay time (OFF → 50ms → 100ms → 175ms → 250ms → 375ms)
         
          GATE - Changes gate length (how long notes are)
          
          OCTAVE - Shifts pitch up/down by octaves
          
          MUTATE - Cycles mutation modes (makes sound evolve randomly on each sync in trigger)


More details on the Mutate Function:

           Mutate works only with pitch and is controled by the pitch knob
           
           It will also only work with a sync in

           
           There are 3 sub menus
           
          1.  Mutation Probability (0-100%)
           
          2.  Rhythm - controls musical Scale Selection Cycles through: MIN PENT → MAJOR → BLUES → MINOR

          3.  Cutoff - Filter Cutoff (200-4000Hz)


           Mutate can be turned off by double tapping the mutate button and turned back on by tapping the mutate button
           Each function once set, is locked into place.


8 Keyboard Keys:

         Press keys 1-8 to play different notes in a musical scale

         Works like a mini keyboard - each key plays a specific pitch

         Also activates the special features
