Instruments:

DUB SIREN - Classic reggae/dub sounds with 6 modes

RAY GUN - Sci-fi laser effects with 4 sound modes

LEAD SYNTH - Generative sequencer with 4 pattern modes

DISCO - 6 classic disco sound effects (orchestra hits, string sweeps, etc.)



These can all be played via the hardware interface:

4 Potentiometers - pitch, speed, modulation, and echo. However, they will change depending on what instrument or function you are using!

8-Key Keyboard

Multiple Buttons - Mode switching, gate control, delay cycling, mutation

mutation allows you to play around with the generative sequencer and musical scales when a sync in is active. - very fun!

Sync Input - trigger input

Real-time waveform visualization



Functions - I have currently 5 functions included with 3 more to come

SEQUENCER MODE (Function + Key 1) - 8-step programmable sequencer with per-step pitch control and enable/disable

LOOP PATTERNS (Function + Key 2) - 7 rhythmic gate patterns (swing, staccato, ratchet, etc.)

RECORD MODE (Function + Key 3) - Record up to 5 seconds of audio with loop playback

REVERSE MODE (Function + Key 4) - Reverse delay with pitch shifting (-2 to +2 octaves)

INFINITE HOLD (Function + Key 5) - Infinite sustain via 100% feedback (this is delay on forever!)
